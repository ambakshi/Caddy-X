### About

Caddy-X is a cross platform downloader and builder with plugin support. This tool can download and extract Caddy web server from official website. What is awesome about this tool is that it can build Caddy with plugin (you need 'git' and 'go' installed on your system). I often build Caddy in different os and manually importing every plugin to sources is PITA hence this tool was born.

#### Example commands:

Download to current folder: `caddyx get`

with plugin: `caddyx get -p your.plugin,name`

Build: `caddyx build`

with plugin: `caddyx build -p your.plugin,name`
